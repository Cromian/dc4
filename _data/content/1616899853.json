We proposed that the best path forward was to rebuild the app in Drupal 9 and serve it as a single-click Drupal Install profile.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">What we did:<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The first task was to replicate the original functionality in Drupal 9. We were fortunate to spin up an old version of the code and analyze what worked and what did not\u2014using that, we were able to quickly develop a new simplified and straightforward user experience. We decided to leverage Bootstrap as the base theme to speed up development, simplifying our total theme development to 1-2 days. The result was an entire platform re-architecture done in as little as one week!<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">New Marketing website:<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Additionally, we designed and launched a new marketing website using our very own CMS, TypeTote.

We were so moved by the project that we offered to be the project stewards moving forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>","meta":{"entity_type":"post","category":"work","entity_status":"published","tags":"","featured_image":"","path":"work\/mobilizing-communities-with-openreporter","date_published":"03\/28\/2021","date_edited":"03\/28\/2021","entity_id":"1616899853"},"summery":"Read how within a few weeks, rebuilt a SaaS application into an open-source Drupal distribution."}
