We proposed that the best path forward was to rebuild the app in Drupal 9 and serve it as a single-click Drupal Install profile.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">What we did:<\/span><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The first task was to replicate the original functionality in Drupal 9. We were fortunate to spin up an old version of the code and analyze what worked and what did not\u2014using that, we were able to quickly develop a new simplified and straightforward user experience. We decided to leverage Bootstrap as the base theme to speed up development, simplifying our total theme development to 1-2 days. The result was an entire platform re-architecture done in as little as one week!<\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">New Marketing website:<\/span><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Additionally, we designed and launched a new marketing website using our very own CMS, TypeTote. This allowed the founder to easily post updates and reduce the total maintenance required.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Result:<\/span><\/p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Within two weeks, OpenReporter went from a dormant domain to a full-fleshed-out, open-source application that now can help communities empower and mobilize to promote change. We were so moved by the project that we offered to be the project stewards moving forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p>","meta":{"entity_type":"post","category":"work","entity_status":"published","tags":"","featured_image":"","path":"work\/moblizing-communites-with-openreproter","date_published":"03\/28\/2021","date_edited":"03\/28\/2021","entity_id":"1616899853"},"summery":"When the original creator of OpenReproter in early 2021 decided he would like to un-archive the code and restore the platform"}
