The team found itself spending more time dealing with operational and system issues than custom and product development. We knew from the start that any solution required maximizing automation on operational tasks so the team can do what they do best. To do this, we decided to leverage WordPress with WooComerce for its customization and flexibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Out of the box, WooComerce came with many of the significant e-commerce functions we needed, and with the plugin nature of WordPress spinning up, the site was relatively simple. This approach's benefit allowed us to spend more of our resources developing system automatons and brand development.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For the style, we went with creating a custom child theme using the popular Storefront theme. As Storefront had many of the needed theme and functions built-in, we decided to add a style layer on top of it that was minimal to help keep the users' attention on the product (which we think are just awesome).\u00a0Additionally\u00a0we developed the base design to deploy unique campaign pages for products part of a more extensive series. In the end, the team had a digital solution that was easy to use and flexible to help them achieve their needs.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The mobile app.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">In addition to the website, we were also fortunate to have been able to design and build their mobile app. The OllyJolly Mobile app was an enjoyable project to work on as it was a simple app that sent users daily motivational messages. Using a custom-derived framework, we built a native iOS app using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While we enjoyed learning a bit of Swift to help fix the gaps along the way, we loved how we could use the flexibility, power, and creativity of the web to achieve this.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><br><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The end result:<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">In the end, OllyJolly was very satisfied with the work we did. Our ability to help develop their online e-commerce presence, streamline processes, and provide the technical support needed makes it an excellent on-going relationship.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>","meta":{"entity_type":"post","category":"work","entity_status":"published","tags":"","featured_image":"","path":"work\/promoting-self-empowerment-with-ollyjolly","date_published":"03\/28\/2021","date_edited":"03\/28\/2021","entity_id":"1616900218"},"summery":"Read how we designed and built an online-e-commerce system for a self-empowerment brand."}
